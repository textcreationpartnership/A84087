         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>All ſpirits would prove favourable unto you, ſince you have convinced them by your merits.</p>
            <p>Your generous diſpoſition hath permitted me a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger audience than your affairs could wel permit.</p>

            <p>Sir, I am ſo far from hiding my own defects, that I acknowledge there is none ſo imperfect as my ſelfe, neither can any man arrive to perfection, except hee be adorned with thoſe abilities whereof I am utterly ignorant.</p>

            <p>Miſtris, I deſire to paſs my life in the pleaſing dreams of your perfections.</p>
            <p>Your Courtly voice is like an Oracle, either to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or condemn me.</p>

            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:153189:12"/>
            <p>From the firſt minute of my acquaintance, I made haſt, as I ſhall ever, to acknowledge my ſelf your moſt humble ſervant.</p>
            <p>Sir, I entertain theſe paſſions, to the end that you may appeaſe them.</p>
            <p>Madam, If you ſtill perſevere to dote thus on your beauty, the time wil come when your face will ſcare you more than a Judge doth a felon.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have quitted all complacency, and there is no means ſhall make me ſilent.</p>
            <p>Faireſt, There is no part of the World ſo remote, whither my curioſity in your ſearch ſhall not carry me.</p>
            <p>Lady, The morall of my affection is to inſtruct you to make uſe of your youth, and to gather Noſe-gayes before the Roſes wither: For be confident, when you have no further attractions than an eloquent tongue, no man wil ſeek for them in the furrows of your face; and you ſhall only be left to bewaile the ruines of your beauty.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſuffer your ſelf to be convinced by reaſon, ſince you cannot reſiſt the ſame, but to your diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>Sir, you muſt excuſe me, ſince I know not in what manner to ſuffer ſo wounding a diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Sir, All the water in the ſea can never purifie me from this offence.</p>
            <p>Lady, You have no more beauty than wil ſerve to excuſe you from being extreamly ugly.</p>
            <p>Sir, If you grant me this favour, you ſhall elevate me to a more Soveraigne Fortune than the ſtate of Kings.</p>
            <p>Sir, It were as great a crime to be ignorant of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions that attend you, as not to be acquainted with the great affluence of noble company, daily repairing to viſit you.</p>
            <p>Miſtris, In my moſt ſolitary walkes it ſhall be my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153189:13"/> ambition to preſume only to revolve you in my moſt ſecret cogitations.</p>
            <p>Sir, In you alone I muſt commend the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all vertue.</p>
            <p>In all ſhapes, and under the moſt dreadful aſpects that can appear, I am yours.</p>
            <p>To return you complements for ſuch excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, were to undervalue their worth, ſince my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is too poor, and unable to lend me wherewith to pay you.</p>
            <p>I fear I ſhal be indebted to you all my life, for the favours I have received of you.</p>
            <p>It is the height of my deſires to be paſſionately, as I am, your moſt faithful ſervant.</p>
            <p>My paſſions cannot ſo far tranſport me, but that I ſhall remain as I have ever been, yours.</p>
            <p>Sir, I intend not to commence any real war againſt you, for I acknowledge my colour to be artificial, which I am ready to lay down at your pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Fair Creature; Painters and ſtage-players are not guilty of thoſe Murthers which the dart of your eyes do moſt cruelly commit.</p>
            <p>I am not ſo curious as to condemn the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude, which have loſt themſelves in the admiration of your vertues.</p>
            <p>I wil dilate my ſelf no further in my Expreſsions, leſt I diſhonour your goodneſs with my undervaluing praiſes.</p>
            <p>Sir, Mine eloquence wil come too late, ſince there is no precept in all humane wiſdome, which hath not preſented it ſelf to your view.</p>
            <p>Sir, The conſolation I have next to the aſſurance I have of my innocencie, is the liberty I enjoy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf yours.</p>
            <p>The principall object of my intentions, hath ever been the glory of your name.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:153189:13"/>
            <p>Sir, I do profeſs my ſelf yours, with all thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, which are able to make truth appear in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.</p>
            <p>Sir, I proſtrate all my preſumption at your feet, and ſhall diſpaire of being happy, if not reputed yours.</p>
            <p>Sir, I can no longer conceale my thoughts, ſince you have an intereſt both in me and them.</p>
            <p>I never gave you viſit, which culed me not of ſome paſsion.</p>
            <p>How often with your Golden Eloquence, have you taken me out of my ſelf?</p>
            <p>You alone can conduct me to the higheſt pitch of accidentall perfection.</p>
            <p>The beams of your eminent vertues have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me mine own perfections.</p>
            <p>In ſtead of all thoſe high expreſsions you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me, I muſt onlie anſwer you, That I am your humble ſervant.</p>
            <p>Sir, There can be no acknowledgement that I can make, can be anſwerable to the obligations I owe to your honour.</p>
            <p>Sir, You miſtake my diſpoſition, if you ſuppoſe I affect praiſes with the like intemperance, as I do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes.</p>
            <p>Sir, Should I forfeite ſuch occaſions, my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would never appeare but remain as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, The world would end, and Nature prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, if there were no ſuch men to maintain her honors.</p>
            <p>Continue to expreſs your ſelf what you are, that your vertue may be its own recorder.</p>
            <p>Faireſt, My thoughts are not ſo often here, as where you are.</p>
            <p>Time which preſcribes limits to all things, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153189:14"/> your beauty to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>The Phyſicians have not ſo far exhauſted me, but that there are ſome drops of blood left, to beſtow in part of your honors ſervice.</p>
            <p>Madam, Put on thoſe rayes of your beauty, that it may bud again with the next Roſes.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I was more aſtoniſhed, then to finde ſuch an equipage of ſorrow about you.</p>
            <p>Sir, You are adorned with all excellent qualities that Art and Nature can beſtow, for the commanding of men.</p>
            <p>Sir, There is not one part of your body, whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is not maſter.</p>
            <p>Sir, It is not in my power to diſpoſe of one ſingle hair ſince I am all yours.</p>
            <p>Madam, you draw the eyes of all to admire you, ſince you are as a faire proſpect, adorned with all pleaſures to allure the beholders.</p>
            <p>You are the Cabinet, in which nature hath lock't all her miracles.</p>
            <p>Though I receive injuries from you, it ſhal be my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility not to take notice of them.</p>
            <p>Sir, I would viſit thoſe parts of the world which ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice it ſelf hath not yet found out, rather than loſe your ſociety.</p>
            <p>Sir, It is impoſſible for me to conceale my ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>Sir, What violence ſoever I offer to my anger, I can no longer contain it.</p>
            <p>Sir, You do ſo heap your favours on me, that you wil not ſo much as ſuffer me to ſeem miſerable.</p>
            <p>Sir, Your innocent actions carry their warrant with them.</p>
            <p>Sir, You do not ſo much expreſs your wit, as your Tyranny, in inflicting ſuch torments on me.</p>
            <p>Sir, be not confident, leſt he whom you have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153189:14"/> injured, do at laſt grow weary of his ſufferings.</p>
            <p>You are the man with whom alone I deſire to paſs the moſt pleaſant hours of my life.</p>
            <p>Sir, If you pretend excuſes for ſo poore a trifle, know I am no longer your affectionate ſervant</p>
            <p>Sir, I, ſhall hold my eloquence as pernicious as the perfections of a Courtezan, ſhould it prove any cauſe of your quarrels.</p>
            <p>You uſurp a more abſolute authority over wits than is lawful or reaſonable.</p>
            <p>You ſmell too much of your Musk, and Amber, to expreſs your ſelf ſerious in the weight of affairs.</p>
            <p>Sir, My conceptions are popular, and to be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible among women.</p>
            <p>Your conceits are too far fetched, and they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the ſubject on which you beſtow them.</p>
            <p>Faireſt, let me raviſh a kiſs from your hand.</p>
            <p>Sir, My affections ſpring not from the diſeaſes and diſtempers of my ſoul, ſince my inclinations to ſerve you, have their originall from immortall reaſon.</p>
            <p>Miſtris, You have a power to infuſe love and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into the hearts of Barbarians.</p>
            <p>You cannot beſtow favours amiſs on him who harh ſearcht the ſecrets of nature, and the depth of Philoſophy, that he might not appear to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>Sir, you muſt give me leave to admire your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which appears to be far more excellent than your Fortunes.</p>

            <p>Sir, In this exigence of my fortune, I am forc'd to admire your vertues, ſince you ſtil ſet ſo high a value on your creature, who is loſt to all men but to your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Sir, Your goodneſs is as unlimitable, as the deſire I have to ſerve you.</p>

            <p>Lift not me ſo high with your favours, leſt you do but fit me for a precipice, and I behold my deſcent with a greater terrour.</p>
            <p>Faireſt, Let not your heavenly beautie, ſeated in its royal Majeſty, draw forth the ſword of diſdain, to the ruine of your creature.</p>
            <p>Faireſt Creature, Since <hi>I</hi> am the pattern of all ill fortunes, by the force of your affection free me from all the miſeries that oppreſs me.</p>
            <p>You hit my inclinations, ſince to recompence ſuch vertues, were a work moſt worthie of all generous ſpirits.</p>
